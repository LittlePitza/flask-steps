# FlaskSteps

## About
Welcome to **FlaskSteps**, a repository where I document my journey learning Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. This repository includes various projects, notes, and experiments as I progress through different aspects of Flask development.

### Why Flask?
Flask is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers. By breaking down the learning process into manageable steps, this repository aims to help anyone interested in mastering Flask.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- **Basic Blogging Platform**
  - A simple blog with user authentication, posts, and comments.
  
- **To-Do List Application**
  - A basic to-do list app with CRUD operations.
  
- **REST API**
  - A RESTful API for managing a collection of items.

## Tutorials
A list of tutorials and resources that have helped me along the way:

- [Official Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Real Python Flask Series](https://realpython.com/tutorials/flask/)
- [Flask Mega-Tutorial by Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

## Getting Started
To get started with any of the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlaskSteps.git
   cd FlaskSteps
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   Each project directory should contain a `README.md` file with specific instructions on how to run that particular project.

## Roadmap
Here's a rough outline of what I plan to cover:

- [x] Learn Basic Routing and Templates
- [x] Implement User Authentication
- [ ] Integrate with Databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Build a REST API
- [ ] Deploy Applications to Production
